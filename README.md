# Weather-Dashboard

Build an application to allow users to search a city and see the city name, date and current weather with a weather icon.  The current weather should also display the temperature, wind speed, humidity and UV Index.  A five-day forecast should also be available with a date, weather icon for the forecast, temperature, wind speed, and humidity levels.  The searched cities should be saved and displayed in a list of buttons that the user can then click on again to load that weather forecast.
